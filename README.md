# React Native CircleCI Orb
A [CircleCI Orb](https://circleci.com/orbs/) to simplify testing your React Native app.

## Why?
Setting up CircleCI to test your React Native app correctly is hard. You need to consider using the correct machine type, installing the correct dependencies, running the correct commands, and correctly setting up caching to speed up builds. All of this is complicated and involves a lot of trial and error.

With this Orb we provide simple reusable building blocks which you can use to do the right thing easily.
